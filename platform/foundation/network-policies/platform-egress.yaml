# Platform HTTPS Egress Policy
# Allows services to access external HTTPS endpoints (e.g., JWKS, external APIs)
#
# Rationale:
# - JWKS endpoints (Neon, Auth0, etc.) use dynamic AWS IPs
# - IP-based policies require constant maintenance as cloud providers rotate IPs
# - HTTPS egress is necessary for JWT validation, external API calls
# - DNS resolution required for domain-based access
#
# Security:
# - Limited to port 443 (HTTPS only)
# - DNS queries allowed for name resolution
# - No HTTP (port 80) access
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
